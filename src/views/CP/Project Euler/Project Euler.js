              Agripool is a cross-platform native application. This is an app
              that connects the farmers to the transporters. The aim was to make
              sure that a transporter’s truck never leaves half filled from the
              village when going to the wholesale market. This ensures
              significant gains for the transporters and reduced transportation
              expenses for the farmers. In simple terms, it is uberpool for
              farmers.
